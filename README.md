# Weather-Prediction-Using-Big-Data
### CSE3025- Large Scale Data Processing Project 

---
#### OUTCOMES:

* To find out the maximum and minimum temperature of the city for a 
year from map-reduce.
* To analyze the weather data to find out the precipitation levels and 
amount of rainfall for a year.
* To predict the probability weather conditions using the simple Naïves 
Bayesian classification method.
* To provide visualization of the data and compare the rainfall and 
precipitation levels.

TOOLS USED:
* Java Open-JDK-7 
* Hadoop Tool 2.7.1
* PyCharm

#### IMPLEMENTATION
* *To find the hottest, coldest day from the data depending on temperature and comparing precipitation levels to find whether a particular day received light, moderate or heavy rains using Map-Reduce Programming*

* *Naïve Bayesian Classifier Implementation for Weather Prediction*
* *Rainfall Prediction Using Linear Regression Model*
